<p>
Swift allows us to store data two ways, depending on whether you want the data to change over time or not.
</p>

The first option is a **Variable** and as the name suggests the value can *change* over time.

```swift
var greeting = "Hello, playground"
```

<br>

The second is a **Constant**, and again as the name suggests the value can not *ever* be changed.
```swift
let name = "Brandon"
```

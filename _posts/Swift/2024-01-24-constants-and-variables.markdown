<p>
Swift allows us to store data two ways, depending on whether you want the data to change over time or not.

**Variable**
```swift
var greeting = "Hello, playground"
```

**Constant**
```swift
let name = "Brandon"
```

In Swift, constants and variables are fundamental components for managing data. Constants, declared using the *let* keyword, represent values that remain unchanged throughout the program's execution, ensuring immutability for stability and safety. They are particularly useful for storing values that should not be modified once set. On the other hand, variables, declared with the *var* keyword, allow for the representation of mutable data whose values can be updated during the program's runtime. This mutability provides flexibility for scenarios where values need to be modified or reassigned based on changing conditions. Both constants and variables contribute to code readability, safety, and adaptability in Swift programming, offering developers the tools to effectively manage and manipulate data in their applications.

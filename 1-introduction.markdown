Greetings, I am Brandon Card. I currently reside in Michigan, my birthplace. The majority of my formative years were spent in Washington State, where I received my education. During high school, I had the privilege of attending New Market, a skills center, where I acquired proficiency in coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
In my early twenties, my family made the decision to relocate to Michigan, prompting me to follow suit. Presently, I am actively re-engaging with CSS and JavaScript, disciplines I haven't explored since high school. Additionally, I am venturing into Swift, a new and unexplored programming language.
</p>


On this platform, I intend to engage in discussions pertaining to topics that capture my interest or warrant further exploration. Should you wish to reach out, please feel free to contact me at [bozo3887@gmail.com](mailto: {{ site.email }} ?subject=Hello.) or leave a comment. I assure you that I will respond at my earliest convenience. Thank you.

Hello, I'm Brandon Card. I currently reside in Michigan, although I spent most of my younger years in Washington State where I grew up. I am presently engaged in learning CSS, JavaScript and Swift. On this site, I will be discussing topics that I find interesting or wish to learn more about. Feel free to contact me at [bozo3887@gmail.com](mailto: {{ site.email }} ?subject=What's%20Up?) or leave a comment and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.
